For st18c7bnn(Nook Tablet 7" 2018):

**These instructions are intended for Linux based OS's**


Building TWRP:

1: Download TWRP minimal source for android 8.1. These links are helpful https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/READ_ME_FIRST https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_omni
2: Make a device folder (if it doesn't already exist) and then make a bn folder in it.
3: Put the android_twrp_bn_st18c7bnn in the device/bn folder, named as st18c7bnn.
4: Open a terminal in the folder you put TWRP in and synced it in. Run "source build/envsetup.sh" and "export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true"
5: Run "lunch st18c7bnn-eng" and "make recoveryimage" and hopefully it will build a functional recovery.img with TWRP.

Building LineageOS:

1: Download LineageOS 15.1 source code (instructions at https://github.com/LineageOS/android
2: Create a "bn" folder in the device and vendor folders.
3: Place android_device_bn_st18c7bnn in device/bn as st18c7bnn.
4: Place android_vendor_bn_st18c7bnn in vendor/bn as st18c7bnn.
5: Open a terminal in the directory LineageOS was downloaded to. 
6: In the terminal, type in "source build/envsetup.sh" 
7: In the terminal, type in "brunch lineage_st18c7bnn-userdebug". 
NOTE: Brunch is currently broken with my device tree for st18c7bnn.
If you encounter an error when trying to build near the end, just use "lunch lineage_st18c7bnn-userdebug" and "make bootimage recoveryimage vendorimage" instead. This will not make a TWRP zip, but will make images that you can flash.
